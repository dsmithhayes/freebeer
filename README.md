freebeer

freebeer comes as a collection of loosely-knit, interoperable utilities.  Each is developed and documented separately.

* freebeer: a web UI that interfaces with freebeerd's JSON API to display releases.
* freebeerctl: a command line utility that takes a directory of music files, creates a release, and adds it to freebeerd.
* freebeerd: a JSON API backed by a persistent database.
